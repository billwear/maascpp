# a sort of rough play-by-play explanation of project activity
*for the curious*

My 64th birthday; FORTY SIX to me.  I started in earnest today to try and decode the MAAS code.  It's a Django app, but I don't *think* I care that much about the Django parts.  I'm not trying to build a Web app, just a series of daemons that lets me learn and follow the low-level network flow of MAAS traffic.  Yeah, maybe there are better ways to do, but what the hell.

Have already figured out how to penetrate down through the Django stuff and get closer to the executables I care about.  Yeah, I know they're Twisted daemons running at the bidding of a Django call or two, though I'm not totally clear on that atm. There's a lot more learning work to do.
