# maasccp

This is a reference implementation of the Canonical MAAS product in the C++ programming language.  A few important things about this code:

1. It is intended to help me (and others) learn the deep software architecture of MAAS, and understand the MAAS theory of operation, by porting the code to another language.

2. This really is a direct port, not a redesign or rewrite.  I plan to try to reproduce the existing Python code with the closest thing to a 1:1 correspondence possible.

3. This is strictly an educational tool.  It isn't warranted for any particular operational use or purpose, so don't expect it to be a C++ replacement for MAAS.  That isn't a goal of this project, so if you try to use it for your particular application, caveat emptor.

That said, on with the code.
